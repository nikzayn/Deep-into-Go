# Deep-into-Go
In this repository, I practiced some concepts of Go Lang via udemy 

I learned some major concepts on Golang and there is yet more to learn. 

##Note: If you want to run the code, please open the code files in vscode, because it will automatically detect
the file extension and download the packages related to it.

###All Thanks to Stephen Grider
